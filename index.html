									<h2>Your Doc</h2>
									<p>In the "YourDoc" project, I took the lead in designing and developing a smart doctor appointment booking system. The core objective of this system was to provide a convenient platform for patients to schedule appointments with doctors based on their availability, eliminating the need for in-person clinic visits. This not only enhanced the patient experience but also streamlined the appointment scheduling process for healthcare providers. To ensure a seamless and paperless consultation process, I engineered a patient profile system. This system allowed doctors to upload medical reports and share them with patients or other medical professionals. The backend was developed using Node.js, while the frontend was built with React.js, ensuring a user-friendly and responsive interface. Furthermore, I implemented rigorous unit testing and integration testing to ensure the reliability and performance of the system. To facilitate the deployment and continuous improvement of the project, a streamlined Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline was established. This project aimed to revolutionize the way patients interact with healthcare services by making doctor appointments more accessible and efficient.</p>

									<h2>Trivia Game</h2>
									<p>In the development of the Trivia Game platform, I spearheaded a project that aimed to deliver a feature-rich and engaging gaming experience. The project's focus was on seamlessly integrating cutting-edge technologies to provide an immersive gaming platform for users. To achieve this, I utilized a Multi-Cloud approach, leveraging services from both Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This integration allowed us to create a comprehensive trivia game solution that covered various aspects, including game logic, user management, and scoring systems. The platform was designed to provide users with a captivating and competitive gaming experience, offering a wide range of trivia questions and challenges. By utilizing services from multiple cloud providers, we ensured redundancy and reliability in the game's operation. This project exemplified my ability to work with diverse technologies and platforms to create innovative and engaging solutions for users.</p>

									<h2>Data Pipeline</h2>
									<p>In the data pipeline project, I designed and implemented an efficient AWS-based data pipeline to automate the conversion of JSON to CSV format, facilitating streamlined data analysis in Amazon QuickSight. Leveraging Amazon S3 for storage and AWS Lambda for event-driven triggers, the pipeline ensured seamless and real-time processing of data. The project also incorporated AWS Glue for data integration, providing optimized data flow and storage. Terraform was utilized for infrastructure as code, ensuring scalability and maintainability. The end-to-end process, from data ingestion to transformation and analysis, adhered to best practices in data management, enabling robust insights for decision-making.</p>
